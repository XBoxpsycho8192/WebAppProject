To run the webpage run this command in the terminal: flask --app main run --debug

!!! If you want to work on THIS Project in Windows - Do step 4 ONLY.
!!! If your not on Windows and need to activate the virtual environment run this command: .venv\Scripts\activate

Starting new flask project:
1. To make a flask project create a folder that your project will exist in.
2. Then populate that folder with a python file named app.py, the name really doesn't matter.
3. In the terminal run this command: py -3 -m venv .venv   This will create a virtual environment that your flask install will exist in.
4. You now need to activate the virtual environment. To do this follow the instructions bellow in order.

"Bypass Windows script security, then the set back to default for your safety."
To activate the virtual environment run these commands, in this order, in the terminal.

RUN in Terminal --->  get-ExecutionPolicy ; Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process ; get-ExecutionPolicy ; .venv\Scripts\activate ; Set-ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope Process ; get-ExecutionPolicy

OR

run these commands line-by-line  -->

                                        get-ExecutionPolicy
                                        Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
                                        .venv\Scripts\activate
                                        Set-ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope Process
                                        get-ExecutionPolicy

5. Now install flask with the command: pip install Flask.   !make sure your terminal has (.venv) at the start of the command line.
6. Now you can code.


Docker Image Troubleshooting:
Image must run with ports set to 5000:5000   (host port is 5000)

This app seams to only want to run properly with  python:3.11-alpine   (Ref 1st line in Dockerfile)

If you need to recreate the Docker file you can use this command to regenerate the requirements.txt file. Command: pip freeze > requirements.txt

To build a new image use the command:   docker build -t xboxpsycho8192/web-inventory:0.0.!add_version_number_here! .



!!To install SQL Database run the command below, AFTER you have activated the virtual environment.

pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-login  <----IF YOUR HAVING TROUBLE STARTING THE APP RUN THESE COMMANDS IN THE TERMINAL!!

I have already updated the dockerfile and requirements.txt so the new database install instructions are part off the dockerfile.
